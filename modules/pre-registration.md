# Pre-Registration

## Overview

Pre-registration is the web channel of MOSIP. This module enables a user to

* Book an appointment for one or many users for registration by choosing a suitable registration center and time slot
* Enter demographic data & upload supporting documents
* Receive appointment notifications
* Reschedule and cancel appointment

Resident data is sent to registration center before appointment, which can be used during registration.
